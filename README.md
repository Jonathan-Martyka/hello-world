# Introduction

Hello there!

My name is Jonathan. I am a recent from graduate DePaul University with a B.S. in Computer Science. 
  I enjoy video games and researching new topics, so putting my abilities to the test is what I like to do best! 
  C#, C++, and Java is where it's at in my book as I absolutely love Object Oriented Programming.

My personal motto is: Always enjoy a good challenge and never stop learning!

If you're interested, feel free to take a look around.
