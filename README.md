# hello-world

Hello there!

My name is Jonathan and I can't wait to get going with my project ideas!
I love playing games and researching new topics, so I can't wait to put myself to the test and make something!
C#, C++, and Java is where it's at in my book as I absolutely love me some of that OOP.
See you on the other side!
