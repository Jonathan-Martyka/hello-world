# hello-world

Hello there!

My name is Jonathan. I am a recent graduate DePaul University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
I enjoy video games and researching new topics, so putting my abilities to the test is what I like to do best!
C#, C++, and Java is where it's at in my book as I absolutely love OOP.

My personal motto is: Always enjoy a good challenge and never stop leaning

If you're interested, feel free to take a look around.
